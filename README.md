## Rigorous Coupled Wave Analysis (RCWA) from Maxwell equation

This RCWA simulation is *__<u>"not yet complete".</u>__* <br>
More functions will be implemented soon.<br>

Notable Implemented features are,<br>
 - Inverse rule
 - Normal vector method
 - 3D voxel input
 - NK libraries
 - Redheffer Matrix multiplication

Thing to be implemted, <br>
 - Nearfield extraction
 - Optical Images at certain image plane considering fourier optics (optical system)
 - Reflection/Transmission calculation
 - 3D voxel generator
