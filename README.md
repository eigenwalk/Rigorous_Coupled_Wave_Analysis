## Rigorous Coupled Wave Analysis (RCWA) from Maxwell equation

This simulation software is not yet complete. 

More functions will be implemented soon.

Notable Implemented features are,
 - Inverse rule
 - Normal vector method
 - 3D voxel input
 - NK libraries

Thing to be implemted, 
 - Nearfield extraction
 - Optical Images at certain image plane considering fourier optics (optical system)
 - Reflection/Transmission calculation
 - 3D voxel generator
